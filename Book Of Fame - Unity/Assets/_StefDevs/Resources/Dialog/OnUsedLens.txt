Eagle:GoldenEagleD-1>Enter From Left
Ah, I see you've finally stumbled upon this feature. Have you noticed, perchance, sections
of this book that look off to you? Where the script is, one might say, a tad conflated? You see,
the thing is… ...we have bugs. Shhh!! Not so loud, or the curators will have my feathers for pens.
Alas, rot and decay is the fate of all great things in this world. These bugs, though, they're not the
bugs you're thinking of. These are computer bugs! There’s no canned spray in the world that can
efface these devious critters from our pages. But we have this: the Lens of Auctoritee. A curious
thing, it is. This lens will show us where the bugs are hiding so we can root them out. You want
to give it a try? Go on, raise it above the book's pages.
Yes, just like that. It may seem ordinary now, but if you hover over a corrupted section of
the page... Well, I won't spoil it for you! Go on.

You see, manuscript letters hate bright light. And with good reason: if it's the wrong kind
of light, you risk burning away the ink. Don't be alarmed: this is a special flashlight. We wouldn't
let you damage the manuscripts, after all. Just shine a spotlight on the letters and you'll make the
imposters sweat.

The more you focus the beam, the more the letter will shake. Once you’re sure that you’ve found
a fake letter, click on it with the center of the flashlight to capture it!
